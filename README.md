## Ocean
The goal of Ocean is to build a software & game application development suite. Built with multiple available rendering pipelines.

## Build Instructions
Building the OceanEngine project is very easy, currently only Premake is present for building. Simply enter the __scripts__ folder and run the .bat file for Windows. This will automatically clone any submodules and generate all of the project files for Visual Studio 2022, GIT is expected to be installed for submodule management.

Curently only Windows and Visual Studio 2022 are supported for building.

### Ocean Core
The foundation of the engine is named Ocean Core. This will handl all of the needed processes to run an efficient application.

### Coral Editor
Coral Editor will be the GUI editor available with Ocean.
