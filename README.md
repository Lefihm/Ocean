# OceanEngine
 
The goal of Ocean Engine is to build a software & game application development suite. Built with multiple available rendering pipelines, the hope is to enable applications to have a static / user reactive frame buffer, that also allows a constant framerate area of the canvas asynchronously for cases when a non-static pane is used within a UI canvas (such as a simulation application).

| Event Manager          | Handles input events from user or platform through the [[Window Layer]].                               | Required   | 
| Render Pipeline        | Draws graphics to screen canvas.                                                                       | Required   |
| Render API Abstraction | Enables easier render API options (i.e. Vulcan, OpenGL, DirectX, etc.)                                 | Required   |
| Debugging Support      | System-wide debugging & logging for development / measurement utilities.                               | Required   |
| Scripting API          | Create a scripting API with higher level language (likely C#).                                         | High       |
| Memory Systems         | Memory management / allocation and tracking.                                                           | Required   |
| Entity System          | Object management system (ECS) for game objects or application objects to store attributes.            | Required   |
| Physics Engine         | Physics engine for simulation / game object simulation.                                                | High       |
| File IO System         | Read / write file management & data management system.                                                 | Required   |
| Build System           | Data compiling & formatting for runtime efficiency. File updating at preview runtime.                  | Required   |
