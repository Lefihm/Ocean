# Ocean Engine

Welcome to Ocean Engine! In order to set up for development, follow the [Installation Setup](./docs/INSTALL.md) and be ready to go!

## Notes

### WSL

It compiles on WSL so it should work assuming Vulkan drivers aren't broken there too. Although there has been repeated difficulties getting UI apps to run properly due to the limitations of WSL.

### MacOS

Good luck.
