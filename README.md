## Building Ocean

The following are notes to ensure proper runtime (not official instructions yet).

TODO: Make platform detection for selections so that only WSL is funky (hopefully).

### Windows

All GLFW options can be disabled, as Windows support is default.

### Linux

It compiles on WSL so it should work assuming Vulkan drivers aren't broken there too.

### MacOS

Good luck.
