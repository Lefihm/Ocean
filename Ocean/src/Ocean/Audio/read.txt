Steps:
Load context
Load HRTF
Load audio files
Load Scene
Load steamaudio things.



Notes:
This should be all accessable during runtime, for now anyway. 
So no templates, until i have to eventually rewrite the whole thing.
I want this in a semi working state before anything smart.

I need to rewrite almost(lmao) everything in here.
Need to make use of structs and static types more
Can also maybe use templates then(avoid classes, unless necessary)
Also the performance of the code will probably,
almost certainly be better than it is now.


Breakdown:
    The following is what at most things can be.

    Audiobuffers section can be a struct.
    HRTF is an object, section can be a class.
    Binaural is an object, section can be a class.
    Ambisonics at most can be a struct.
    Direct Effect is an object section can be a class.
    Scene is an object section can be a class.
    Simulation is an object can be a class
        Subsections of Simulation:
            Reflections
            Baking
            Pathing
